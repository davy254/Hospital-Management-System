# üè• Hospital Management System (Python OOP Showcase)

[![Python OOP HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT](https://github.com/davy254/Hospital-Management-System/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/davy254/Hospital-Management-System/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

A simple project built in Python to demonstrate mastery of the **4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming**:

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Abstraction**
3. **Inheritance**
4. **Polymorphism**

---

## üöÄ Features
- Staff (Doctors & Nurses) inherit from a base class (`Staff`).
- Patients have **private medical records** (Encapsulation).
- Abstract base class `Person` enforces common behavior (Abstraction).
- Doctors and Nurses **perform duties differently** (Polymorphism).
- Uses **getter methods** (like `get_name()`) to access attributes instead of exposing them directly ‚Äî following **OOP best practices**.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```bash
python hospital_system.py
